m3m3 is (will be) a web app allowing users to post comments on current pieces of news, represented by a rolling list of images that is constantly fed by journals' RSS streams.

This is all work in progress. That's my toy project to learn Go.

To try it, just compile m3m3.go and run the binary. You will need to rename the "config.example" directory to "config" first.
